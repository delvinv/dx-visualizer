# dx-visualizer
A visualization tool that will generate a summary visualization of a dataset.

## Description
The visualization can read in csv (and eventually xls/xlsx file).
I will be programming this using Processing.org + Java.

The viz will show the following info:
- Health of the dataset (does it contain missing entries/rows)
- Entries that fail data validation (can be set for each column)
- Summary graphical visualization that will show the 'health' of the dataset at a glance.

Previously, I attempted to do this on a web interface (as seen in the Misc folder). However, this was too slow and I felt it was not suitable for a web browser.
